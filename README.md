# React Dapp

CrypYo ðŸ‘‹

When the app loads, you should be able to fetch the current greeting and log it out to the console. You should also be able to make updates to the greeting by signing the contract with your MetaMask wallet and spending the fake Ether.

## Goals

1. Fetch the current value of `greeting` from the smart contract
2. Allow a user to update the value of the `greeting` using MetaMask wallet

## Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
